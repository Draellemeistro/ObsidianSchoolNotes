#### [7 Encryption Methods To Shield Sensitive Data from Prying Eyes](https://www.getapp.com/resources/common-encryption-methods/)
1. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
2. Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)
3. Triple Data Encryption Standard (DES)
4. Blowfish
5. Twofish
6. Format-Preserving Encryption (FPE)
7. Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)





Some common types of sensitive data include:

1. Login credentials such as usernames and passwords for accessing various platforms, such as Hosting, CMS, ERP, CRM, FTP server, or email marketing tools.
2. API keys, access keys, and tokens required for integrating third-party services or applications.
3. Credit card details and payment information such as bank account numbers, and other payment-related data.
4. [Personally identifiable information](https://hypervault.com/data-templates/personal-identification-information/) (PII) of clients, customers, or employees, such as names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses.
5. Intellectual property in the form of design files, source code, proprietary algorithms, patents, or copyrighted material.
6. Confidential documents such as marketing plans, sales strategies, financial projections, and other confidential business information.
7. Contracts & legally binding documents.
8. IT and IT-security-related information such as network architecture diagrams, security policies, or vulnerability assessments.
9. Sensitive multimedia content. This can be unreleased photos, videos, or audio recordings related to a client's project or campaign.
10. Research and development (R&D) data: Information about ongoing or planned R&D projects, including prototypes, experimental data, or research findings

**Problemkassser**

- 'stemmesedlen'/verifikation af faktisk gyldig vælger
- kryptering af valgsvar
- Vælger skal ikke kunne identificeres ud fra data de sender (eller rettere, skal ikke kunne kobles til den specifikke data dekrypteret)
