> Blockchain is a distributed and decentralized public ledger managed by a peer-to-peer network. Once the data in one block undergoes change, the revision process is recorded and shared by all the other blocks in the blockchain system. In other words, it is impossible to amend the data secretly. This is a clear advantage in an e-voting system because blockchain itself can monitor whether the voting results are manipulated by external forces. Any forced revision of data is detected immediately. The transparency of a blockchain network leads to credibility of the total e-voting system. Moreover, the main characteristic of blockchain system, especially public blockchain, is that its network is decentralized. Decentralized networks avoid reliance on any central authority; decisions for the total system are made by a majority of the members in the network. Decentralization of blockchain networks can prevent any possible corruption of total e-voting systems created by central authorities.

> **E-voting systems based on blockchain technology might have difficulty in preserving end-to-end privacy** cryptographic techniques, such as homomorphic encryption, ring signature, and blind signature, can ensure that a blockchain-based e-voting system is able to preserve the privacy of voters ([Privacy and verifiability in voting systems: Methods, developments and trends](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574013713000282))
> In particular, [Large-scale election based on blockchain](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050918302874) introduces a new e-voting system that uses blockchain and a ring signature. **The uniqueness of this e-voting system is that it enables large-scale elections, unlike other blockchain-based e-voting systems.**
