# [A Threat Analysis of Prêt à Voter](https://link-springer-com.zorac.aub.aau.dk/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-12980-3_12)
security of even the best-designed technical systems can be undermined by socio-technical weaknesses that stem from implementation flaws, environmental factors that violate (often implicit) assumptions and human fallibility. This is especially true of cryptographic voting systems, which typically have a large user base and are used infrequently.
Karlof et al: [Cryptographic Voting Protocols: A Systems Perspective.](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/sec05/tech/full_papers/karlof/karlof.pdf)
ave performed an analysis of the [Chaum](https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.zorac.aub.aau.dk/abstract/document/1264852/) and [Neff](http://www.votehere.net/documentation/vhti) schemes from the “systems perspective”. By stepping outside the purely technical, protocol specifications, they identify a number of potential vulnerabilities of these schemes. In this paper, we perform a similar analysis of the [Prêt à Voter](https://link-springer-com.zorac.aub.aau.dk/doi/10.1007/11555827_8) (se evt: [Prêt à Voter: a system perspective](https://eprints.ncl.ac.uk/file_store/production/160890/53DAB2CE-29EA-4A11-A990-24F507141CCE.pdf))
**==chain-voting attacks and more are potential threat in Prêt à Voter, or indeed any crypto system with pre-printed ballot forms. Where appropriate, we propose enhancements and counter-measures.==**

# [Anonymity in Voting Revisited](https://link-springer-com.zorac.aub.aau.dk/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-12980-3_13)
re-examine anonymity with respect to voting, and generalise existing notions of anonymity in e-voting.
- identify and categorise the types of attack that can be a threat to anonymity of the voter, including different types of vote buying and coercion
- categorisation of anonymity in voting in terms of:
	- **strength of the anonymity achieved**
	- **extent of interaction between voter and attacker**
- Some of the combinations, including weak and strong receipt-freeness, are formalised in epistemic logic.


# [Verifying Privacy-Type Properties of Electronic Voting Protocols: A Taster](https://link-springer-com.zorac.aub.aau.dk/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-12980-3_18)
recent studies have highlighted inadequacies in implemented systems. **We particularly focus on anonymity properties, namely vote-privacy and receipt-freeness.** 
We illustrate our definitions on two electronic voting protocols from the literature. Ideally, these properties should hold even if the election officials are corrupt. However, protocols that were designed to satisfy privacy or receipt-freeness may not do so in the presence of corrupt officials. Our model and definitions allow us to specify and easily change which authorities are supposed to be trustworthy.
