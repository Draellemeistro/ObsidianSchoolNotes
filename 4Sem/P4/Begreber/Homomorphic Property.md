> [!Homomorphic Encryption]
> [Homomorphic encryption](https://crypto.stanford.edu/craig/craig-thesis.pdf) is a cryptographic technique that enables computations of encrypted data. To be precise, the result of computing encrypted data is equal to the result of encrypting the computation of plain data.
> . In order to compute encrypted data without using homomorphic encryption, encrypted data must undergo decryption; this process creates a risk of exposing plain data and weakens the overall security of the database. Thus, homomorphic encryption guarantees data security by eliminating the need to send plain data
> - has weaknesses that hinder practical implementation
> 	- Data that deploys homomorphic encryption cannot help but require large capacity
> 	- speed of encrypting plain data and of computing encrypted data are not fast enough to be practical
> 	- The accuracy of homomorphic encryption for large-scale data is also in doubt because the noise, that occurs with every computation, eventually becomes too large to ignore.
