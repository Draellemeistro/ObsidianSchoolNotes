# [On Some Incompatible Properties of Voting Schemes](https://link-springer-com.zorac.aub.aau.dk/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-12980-3_11)
the problem of simultaneously achieving several security properties, for voting schemes, without non-standard assumptions.
**we focus on the universal verifiability of the computation of the tally, on the unconditional privacy/anonymity of the votes, and on the receipt-freeness properties, for the most classical election processes.**

==a voting system that wants to publish the final list of the voters who actually voted, and to compute the number of times each candidate has been chosen, we cannot achieve:=
- ==universal verifiability of the tally (UV) and unconditional privacy of the votes (UP) simultaneously, unless _all_ the registered voters actually vote==
- ==universal verifiability of the tally (UV) and receipt- freeness (RF), unless private channels are available between the voters and/or the voting authorities.==


# [A Practical and Secure Coercion-Resistant Scheme for Internet Voting](https://link-springer-com.zorac.aub.aau.dk/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-12980-3_20)
uels, Catalano, and Jakobsson (JCJ) proposed at WPES 2005 the first voting scheme that considers real-world threats and that is more realistic for Internet elections. Their scheme, though, has a quadratic work factor and thereby is not efficient for large scale elections. Based on the work of JCJ, Smith proposed an efficient scheme that has a linear work factor. In this paper we first show that Smith’s scheme is insecure. Then we present a new coercion-resistant election scheme with a linear work factor that overcomes the flaw of Smith’s proposal. Our solution is based on the group signature scheme of Camenisch and Lysyanskaya (Crypto 2004).

We present _Scratch, Click & Vote_ remote voting scheme. The scheme is end-to-end verifiable and allows for voting over the Internet. It guarantees security against malicious hardware and software used by a voter; a voter’s computer does not get any knowledge about the voter’s choice. Moreover, it can blindly change the voter’s ballot with a small probability only.

# [Securing Optical-Scan Voting](https://link-springer-com.zorac.aub.aau.dk/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-12980-3_22)
This paper presents a method for adding end-to-end verifiability to any optical-scan vote counting system. A serial number and set of letters, paired with every candidate, are printed on each optical-scan ballot. The letter printed next to the candidate(s) chosen by the voter is posted to a bulletin board, and these letters are used as input to Punchscan’s verifiable tallying method. The letters do not reveal which candidate was chosen by the voter. The method can be used as an independent verification mechanism that provides assurance that each vote is included in the final tally unmodified—a property not guaranteed by a manual recount. We also provide a proof-of-concept process that allows the election authority to settle disputes after the polls close while preserving ballot secrecy.

# [Attacking Paper-Based E2E Voting Systems](https://link-springer-com.zorac.aub.aau.dk/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-12980-3_23)
In this paper, we develop methods for constructing vote-buying/coercion attacks on end-to-end voting systems, and describe vote-buying/coercion attacks on three proposed end-to-end voting systems: Punchscan, Prêt-à-voter, and ThreeBallot. We also demonstrate a different attack on Punchscan, which could permit corrupt election officials to change votes without detection in some cases. Additionally, we consider some generic attacks on end-to-end voting systems.

# [Aperio: High Integrity Elections for Developing Countries](https://link-springer-com.zorac.aub.aau.dk/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-12980-3_24)
This article presents an ‘end-to-end’ integrity verification mechanism for use in minimally equipped secret paper-ballot election environments. The scheme presented in this paper achieves high integrity properties without interfering with the traditional marking and tabulation procedures of paper-ballot elections. Officials and auditors can respectively generate and independently verify ‘end-to-end’ audit trails, with office stationery and entirely without cryptographic or mathematic computations.
