# blandet feedback
Show the story of the project, how did you figure things out along the way. The journey, where you discover things and make decisions, that should be the focus. The end result is just a byproduct of that journey.



Show how you organized your work, and the work (in progress) itself.

> Emphasize better flow in the text, and make sure the reader can follow your thoughts.
- Also, make sure to explain the concepts you are using, and why you are using them. (dont drop new concepts without explaining them)
- Bring them along on the journey, and make sure they understand the choices you make. (idk, think documentary crew following you along?)

> **LIMITATIONS**, Have it early, and be explicit about them. (and how you worked around them)
- Show you can manage scope, and that you are aware of the limitations of your project.
- You can get limitations (and requirements) from state of the art, and from the project description. (prob. also background)

Don't worry about having requirements scattered around at the points where they are made. It helps show relevance and context (also traceability, and the journey stuff)

(**Dont exactly understand what this means**) Requirements -> traceability -> reflect on the process

uh.. Formalities, get a grasp (and use your supervisor) Don't get dug in, hunkering down in the trenches.

> **HUSK ACCEPTANCE TEST**
