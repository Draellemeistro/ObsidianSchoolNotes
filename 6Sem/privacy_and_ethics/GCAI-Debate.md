AI is schlop. It is mass produced,
What do we do, when AI becomes the defacto means of producing art and media?
The thing that writing is, is a thing that AI cannot do. (what writing is - Stephen King, telepathy, of course)

ChatGPT has fluid and academic sentences, but they don't say anything. Like chatgpt, academic writing uses formal cautious language to avoid ambiguity and misinterpretations.
